Quiz
====

This is a web based application to host a quiz.

How to use
----------

*Requirements: Python (2.7+), Modern Browser*

If you just want to use it (and not developing for it) you can just download
the most recent release from the [release page](../../releases) (there is no use in downloading the source code).

Unzip the file to a folder of your choice. You can now create multiple quizzes
in the `quizzes` subdirectory (see below).

To start the game, execute the `server.py` script. It will output an URL, that you
can now open in a modern browser (most browsers will go into fullscreen on <kbd>F11</kbd>).

### Create quizzes

To create a new quiz, create a new folder (with a name of your choice) in the `quizzes`
directory (no matter if you are using a downloaded version or if you are developing
with the source code).

Place a file named `quiz.json` inside that directory. This JSON files describes your quiz
and looks as follows:

```JSON
{
  "title": "Title of the quiz",
  "items": [
  	...
  ]
}
```

The `items` array contains all the questions (and similiar) in the order
they should appear in the quiz. Each item is an object, that has to have at
least a `type` key. Depending on the `type` it must or can have other fields.

#### Item types

The following item `type`s exists and can/must have the following fields:

* `interlude` - A title like screen (that is no question).
  * `title` - The title that should be shown on the interlude screen.
  * `subtitle` (optional) - A subtitle that should be shown below.
* `image` - A question inside an image.
  * `image` - A path (relative or absolute) to the image.
  * `points` - An amount of points that will be awared for the answer to this question.
  * `solution` - The solution to the question.
  * `label` (optional) - A label (like a question) that will be shown above the image.
  * `source` (optional) - A source (or copyright) of the image. Will be shown subtle below the image.

### Play the game

When opening the game URL you can choose one of the quizzes you created.

#### Settings

On the top right of the screen you can open the **Settings** dialog.
You can set the keys used to control the game in there. These keys will be
referred to as <kbd>next</kbd>, <kbd>correct</kbd>, <kbd>wrong</kbd> and <kbd>end game</kbd> key later.

Settings will be saved even when you refresh, restart your browser or the server.

#### Teams

You can add as many teams as you need on the top left.

If you press the icon on the bottom right of a team box, you get into the team settings.

You can change the team name, manually adjust a teams points, set a buzzer key for that team
or delete the team from the game.

#### Controls

While you are in a game, you can control the game as follows:

* Press <kbd>next</kbd> during the title screen, an *interlude* or when a solution is shown, to jump to the next question.
* When pressing <kbd>next</kbd> while a question is shown, it will show the solution without awarding the points to any team.

* When a question is shown the teams can press their buzzer keys if they want to solve it.
* The team box of the team, that buzzered first will be colored.
* If the team answered correctly press the <kbd>correct</kbd> key.
  * The team will be awared by the specific amount of points and the answer will be shown.
* If the team answered wrong press the <kbd>wrong</kbd> key.
  * The team will be blocked from buzzing for a specific amount of time (indicated by a red progress bar in the team box).

* If either the last question has been reached or at any time you press the <kbd>end game</kbd> button,
the game ends and the result will be shown.

How to develop
--------------

*Requirements: NodeJS, npm, Modern Browser*

* Using Ubuntu you also need the nodejs-legacy package.
* To develop the game make sure you have NodeJS and gulp (`npm install -g gulp`) installed.
* All dependencies will be installed automatically if you do a `npm install` in the root directory of this project.
* Use `gulp` or `gulp serve` to run the game and watch for changes (except changes on the quizzes).
* Use `gulp package` to package a zip file with your current quizzes.
